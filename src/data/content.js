    loveNote: `My love,

This is our first Valentine, and I didn’t want it to be loud.
Just something clean and honest like the way you make ordinary days feel warm.

Thank you for being you. For your softness, your strength, your small care, and understanding.
I’m really happy I get to love you. You are the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 

I love you so much, My Samu Baba. I hope this little website makes you smile today.

Always,
Me`,
